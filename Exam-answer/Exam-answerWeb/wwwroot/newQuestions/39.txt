Northern Trail Outfitters’ European and Asia Pacific sales teams have different business requirements on how to

create new opportunities. The teams must configure a set of geographically-specific fields relevant only to their team as

well as common fields that both teams will utilize. Additionally, each team should NOT be able to report on the other's

region-specific fields.

What solution should be recommended?

A. © Utilize Visualforce to build an opportunity page that dynamically checks the user's region to determine which fields to display.

B. © Build a custom object with private sharing to capture the additional fields as a separate record.

Cc. O Implement field-level security to allow access to fields for the respective regional sales teams.

D. O Create separate page layouts and record types for each of the regional sales teams.
