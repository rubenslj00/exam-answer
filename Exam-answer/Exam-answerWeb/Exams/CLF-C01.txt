Choose which instance type(s) you want, then start, terminate, and monitor as many instances of your AMI as needed, using the web service APIs or the variety of management tools provided.
Determine whether you want to run in multiple locations, utilize static IP endpoints, or attach persistent block storage to your instances.
Pay only for the resources that you actually consume, like instance-hours or data transfer.https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/features/
---
###
How would an AWS customer easily apply common access controls to a large set of users?
---
Apply an IAM policy to an IAM group. *
Apply an IAM policy to an IAM role.
Apply the same IAM policy to all IAM users with access to the same workload.
Apply an IAM policy to an Amazon Cognito user pool.
---
---
A
Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.). Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html

###
Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?
---
Implement single points of failure.
Implement loose coupling. *
Implement monolithic design.
Implement vertical scaling.
---
---
B
Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them. The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer. This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency. So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/
###
Which of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Choose two.)
---
Enable AWS CloudTrail.
Grant least privilege access to IAM users. *
Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
Enable Amazon CloudFront.
Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users. *
---
---
BE
If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case. This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised. For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-protecting-your-aws-account-while-using-programmatic-access/

---
When there is flexibility in when an application needs to run. *
When there are mission-critical workloads.
When dedicated capacity is needed.
When an instance should not be stopped.
---
---
A
The key to understanding spot instances is to look at the way that cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate. Cloud service providers invest in hardware resources and then release those resources (often on a per-hour basis) to subscribers. One of the problems with this business model, however, is that at any given time, there are likely to be compute resources that are not being utilized. These resources represent hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle, and not making AWS any money at the moment.Rather than allowing these computing resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a substantially discounted rate, with the understanding that if someone needs those resources for running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot instances that are using the hardware resources at a discounted rate.In fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed elsewhere.https://awsinsider.net/articles/2017/09/25/aws-spot-instances-primer.aspx

How does AWS charge for AWS Lambda?
---
Users bid on the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour.
Users choose a 1-, 3- or 5-year upfront payment term.
Users pay for the required permanent storage on a file system or in a database.
Users pay based on the number of requests and consumed compute resources. *
---
---
D
AWS Lambda is charging its users by the number of requests for their functions and by the duration, which is the time the code needs to execute. When code starts running in response to an event, AWS Lambda counts a request. It will charge the total number of requests across all of the functions used. Duration is calculated by the time when your code started executing until it returns or until it is terminated, rounded up near to 100ms. The AWS Lambda pricing depends on the amount of memory that the user used to allocate to the function.https://dashbird.io/blog/aws-lambda-pricing-model-explained/
###
What function do security groups serve related Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance security?
---
Act as a virtual firewall for the Amazon EC2 instance. *
Secure AWS user accounts with AWS identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
Provide DDoS protection with AWS Shield.
Use Amazon CloudFront to protect the Amazon EC2 instance.
---
---
A
AWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance on AmazonEC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.After that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers over the internet.AWS Security Groups are very flexible. You can use the default security group and still customize it according to your liking (although we don't recommend this practice because groups should be named according to their purpose.) Or you can create a security group that you want for your specific applications. To do this, you can write the corresponding code or use the Amazon EC2 console to make the process easier.https://www.threatstack.com/blog/aws-security-groups-what-they-are-and-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-them
###
Which disaster recovery scenario offers the lowest probability of down time?
---
Backup and restore
Pilot light
Warm standby
Multi-site active-active *
---
Backup and Restore: a simple, straightforward, cost-effective method that backs up and restores data as needed. Keep in mind that because none of your data is on standby, this method, while cheap, can be quite time-consuming.
Pilot Light: This method keeps critical applications and data at the ready so that it can be quickly retrieved if needed.
Warm Standby: This method keeps a duplicate version of your business' core elements running on standby at all times, which makes for a little downtime and an almost seamless transition.
Multi-Site Solution: Also known as a Hot Standby, this method fully replicates your company's data/applications between two or more active locations and splits your traffic/usage between them. If a disaster strikes, everything is simply rerouted to the unaffected area, which means you'll suffer almost zero downtime. However, by running two separate environments simultaneously, you will obviously incur much higher costs.

###
Which architectural principle is used when deploying an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance in Multiple Availability Zone mode?
---
Implement loose coupling.
Design for failure. *
Automate everything that can be automated.
Use services, not servers.
---
---
B
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/
###

---
It facilitates low-latency request handling.
It allows applications to have dependent workflows.
It prevents cascading failures between different components. *
It allows companies to focus on their physical data center operations.
---
---
C
IT systems should ideally be designed in a way that reduces inter-dependencies. Your components need to be loosely coupled to avoid changes or failure in one of the components from affecting others.Your infrastructure also needs to have well defined interfaces that allow the various components to interact with each other only through specific, technology- agnostic interfaces. Modifying any underlying operations without affecting other components should be made possible.https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/

---
---
BC
Your root account should always be protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This additional layer of security helps protect against unauthorized logins to your account by requiring two factors: something you know (a password) and something you have (for example, an MFA device). AWS supports virtual and hardware MFA devices and U2F security keys.Cognito can be used as an Identity Provider (IdP), where it stores and maintains users and credentials securely for your applications, or it can be integrated withOpenID Connect, SAML, and other popular web identity providers like Amazon.com.Using Amazon Cognito, you can generate temporary access credentials for your clients to access AWS services, eliminating the need to store long-term credentials in client applications.https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-protecting-your-aws-account-while-using-programmatic-access/

---
reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). *
increased capital expenditure (capex). *
reduced operational expenditure (opex).
deferred payment plans for startups.
business credit lines for stratups.
---
---
AB
A core reason organizations adopt a cloud IT infrastructure is to save money. The traditional approach of analyzing Total Cost of Ownership no longer applies when you move to the cloud. Cloud services provide the opportunity for you to use only what you need and pay only for what you use. We refer to this new paradigm as the Total Cost of Operation. You can use Total Cost of Operation (TCO) analysis methodologies to compare the costs of owning a traditional data center with the costs of operating your environment using AWS Cloud services.A pay-as-you-go model reduces investments in large capital expenditures. In addition, you can reduce the operating expense (OpEx) costs involved with the management and maintenance of data. This frees up budget, allowing you to quickly act on innovative initiatives that can't be easily pursued when managingCapEx.https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/total-cost-of-operation-benefits-using-aws.pdf

BE
If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case. This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised. For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-protecting-your-aws-account-while-using-programmatic-access/

Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as flipping a switch. For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there are a few steps to consider -- and it's not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly. If a startup uses on-premise business servers and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that).AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size. It's a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.Reference: https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-aws-storage-gateway
