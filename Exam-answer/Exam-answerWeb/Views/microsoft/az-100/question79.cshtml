                You have a Microsoft Azure subscription that has four virtual machines (VMs) located in the East US region.
                @Html.Raw(Model.H1CloseTag)
            </p>
            <p>
                @Html.Raw(Model.H2OpenTag)
                You configure the four VMs identically to act as web servers.
                @Html.Raw(Model.H2CloseTag)
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to ensure that traffic is distributed equally across the four web servers. You also need to protect the web servers against the most common web application security risks. Your solution must minimize expense.

        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                You should deploy Azure Application Gateway. Application Gateway is a software load balancer that is specialized for web workloads. In addition to providing load balancing services, Application Gateway also includes a web application firewall (WAF) that protects back-end pool web servers against the most common web application vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not deploy a virtual machine scale set because this solution requires the deployment of additional VMs. Moreover, a scale set offers no native protection against web application vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not deploy a Traffic Manager profile because the scenario states that the web servers reside in the same geographic area. Traffic Manager is a Domain Name System (DNS)-based load balancer that works across multiple Azure regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not deploy an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) profile. A CDN makes user access to static web resources faster by geo-distributing those resources. CDN is unrelated to this scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not use the Remove-AzureRmVM cmdlet. You typically use this cmdlet when you want to remove a VM from Azure.
