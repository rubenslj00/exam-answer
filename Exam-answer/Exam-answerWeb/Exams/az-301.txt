Azure AD Domain Services for hybrid organizations
Organizations with a hybrid IT infrastructure consume a mix of cloud resources and on-premises resources. Such organizations synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. As hybrid organizations look to migrate more of their on-premises applications to the cloud, especially legacy directory-aware applications, Azure AD Domain Services can be useful to them.
Example: Litware Corporation has deployed Azure AD Connect, to synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. The identity information that is synchronized includes user accounts, their credential hashes for authentication (password hash sync) and group memberships.
az-301-q30.PNG
User accounts, group memberships, and credentials from Litware's on-premises directory are synchronized to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. These user accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available within the managed domain.
Box 2: User management occurs on-premises. The on-promises domain controller authenticates employee credentials.
You can federate your on-premises environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization. This sign-in method ensures that all user authentication occurs on-premises.

Note:
IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machinThe information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returneWhile any source or destination IP can be chosen,
IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.
IP flow verify looks at the rules for all Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to the network interface, such as a subnet or virtual machine NITraffic flow is then verified based on the configured settings to or from that network interfacIP flow verify is useful in confirming if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine.

A company plans to implement an HTTP-based API to support a web app. The web app allows customers to check the status of their orders.
The API must meet the following requirements:
Implement Azure Functions
Provide public read-only operations
Do not allow write operations
You need to recommend configuration options.
What should you recommend? To answer, configure the appropriate options in the dialog box in the answer area.
---
Allowed authentication methods;All methods;GET only *;GET and POST only;GET, POST and OPTIONS only;
Authorization level;Function;Anonymous *;Admin;
---
Allowed authentication methods: GET only

Authorization level: Anonymous -
The option is Allow Anonymous requests. This option turns on authentication and authorization in App Service, but defers authorization decisions to your application codFor authenticated requests, App Service also passes along authentication information in the HTTP headers.
This option provides more flexibility in handling anonymous requests.

Your network contains an on-premises Active Directory forest named contoso.com. The forest is synced to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contoso.com and an Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) domain named contoso-aad.com.
You have an Azure Storage account named Storage1 that contains a file share named Share1.
You configure NTFS permissions on Share1. You plan to deploy a virtual machine that will be used by several users to access Share1.
You need to ensure that the users can access Share1.
Which type virtual machine should you deploy?
---
a virtual machine that runs Windows Server 2016 and is joined to the contoso.com domain
a virtual machine that runs Windows 10 and is joined to the contoso-add.com domain
a virtual machine that runs Windows 10 and is hybrid Azure AD joined to the contoso.com domain
an Azure virtual machine that runs Windows Server 2016 and is joined to the contoso-add.com domain *
 

---
You join the Windows Server virtual machine to the Azure AD DS-managed domain, here named contoso-aad.com.
Note: Azure Files supports identity-based authentication over SMB (Server Message Block) (preview) through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Domain
Services. Your domain-joined Windows virtual machines (VMs) can access Azure file shares using Azure AD credentials.
Incorrect Answers:
Azure AD authentication over SMB is not supported for Linux VMs for the preview releasOnly Windows Server VMs are supported.

Your company has an on-premises data center and an Azure subscription. The on-premises data center contains a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
Your network contains an Active Directory domain that is synchronized to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
The company is developing an application named Application1. Application1 will be hosted in Azure by using 10 virtual machines that run Windows Server 2016.
Five virtual machines will be in the West Europe Azure region and five virtual machines will be in the East US Azure region. The virtual machines will store sensitive company information. All the virtual machines will use managed disks.
You need to recommend a solution to encrypt the virtual machine disks by using BitLocker Drive Encryption (BitLocker).
Solution: Deploy one Azure Key Vault to each region. Create two Azure AD service principals. Configure the virtual machines to use Azure Disk Encryption and specify a different service principal for the virtual machines in each region.
Does this meet the goal?
---
Yes
No *
---
You would also have to import the security keys from the HSM into each Azure key vault.

The Key Vault has to be in the same region as the VM that will be encrypted.
Note: If you want to use a key encryption key (KEK) for an additional layer of security for encryption keys, add a KEK to your key vault. Use the Add-
AzKeyVaultKey cmdlet to create a key encryption key in the key vault. You can also import a KEK from your on-premises key management HSM.
