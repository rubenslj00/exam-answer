                Your company has an application deployed on Azure Linux virtual machines (VMs). The application is distributed on three different layers using the following structure:
                @Html.Raw(Model.H1CloseTag)
            </p>
            <p>
                @Html.Raw(Model.H2OpenTag)
                * A VM named FRONT01 for the frontend layer
                <br />
                * A VM named BACK01 for the backend layer
                <br />
                * An Azure SQL Database instance for the data layer
                @Html.Raw(Model.H2CloseTag)
            </p>
            <p>
                All resources for this application are deployed in the resource group APP01-RG. All VMs have unmanaged VHDs attached.
            </p>
            <p>
                You plan to deploy a new version the application to provide high availability on the frontend and backend layers. You will deploy this new infrastructure in the resource group APP02-RG.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to create a VHD template for the frontend layer using the current application infrastructure. You can schedule a stop of the application as needed. The VMs only contain the user that was created during the initial deployment of the VM. You also need to ensure that you remove the last provisioned user on the VMs. You decide to use Azure CLI to accomplish this task.

        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                You should run the following commands in order:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. sudo waagent -deprovision+user
                <br />
                2. az vm deallocate --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT01
                <br />
                3. az vm generalize --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT01
                <br />
                4. az vm capture --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT01 --vhd-name-prefix TEMPLATE
            </p>
            <p>
                First, you need to execute the sudo waagent -deprovision+user ssh command on the VM that you will use to create the template. This command will remove all SSH host keys, the nameserver configuration in /etc/resolv.conf, the root password from /etc/shadow, and the cached DHCP client leases. It also resets the hostname to localhost.localdomain. The +user part of the parameter deletes the last provisioned user account and its associated data. This command does not guarantee that any sensitive information on the VMs is cleared and ready for distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you need to deallocate the VM using the az vm deallocate --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT01 command. This command will shut down the VM and release any compute resource associated with it. You are not billed for deallocated VMs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you need to generalize the VM using the az vm generalize --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT01 command. By marking a VM as generalized, you are marking the VM to be used as the source for new VM images or copies of its disks to be used as VHD templates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you need to copy the VM disks using the az vm capture --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT01 --vhd-name-prefix TEMPLATE command. Because you did not set the location for the storage container, the command will copy the VM disks in the vhd container.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not use the az image create --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT_TEMPLATE --source FRONT01 command. This will create a custom image from managed disks or snapshots. You are using unmanaged disks, so you cannot use this command in this scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not use the az vm update --resource-group APP01-RG --name FRONT01 command. This command will update the properties of the VM.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not use the sudo waagent -deprovision command. This SSH command will remove all SSH host keys, the nameserver configuration in /etc/resolv.conf, the root password from /etc/shadow, and the cached DHCP client leases and will reset the hostname to localhost.localdomain. This command does not guarantee that any sensitive information on the VMs is cleared and ready for distribution.
