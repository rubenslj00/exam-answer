                Last month you deployed an Ubuntu Linux server virtual machine (VM) named linux1 to a virtual network (VNet) in Azure.

            <p>
                @Html.Raw(Model.H2OpenTag)
                Today, you need to perform emergency remote management of linux1 from your Windows 10 Enterprise Edition workstation. Your solution must minimize both setup time and administrative effort.

        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                You should connect to the VM by using SSH and Azure Cloud Shell. SSH is the default protocol for remote Linux server management. Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based command shell that gives you access to SSH and a variety of other Azure management tools. In this situation time is of the essence. Therefore, logging into the Azure portal, starting a Cloud Shell, and making an SSH-based connection to linux1 meets all scenario requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not connect to the VM by using SSH and Windows Subsystem for Linux. The feature is available in Windows 10 Pro, Education, or Enterprise, and allows you to run native Linux commands directly on Windows. However, Windows Subsystem for Linux is not installed by default, and taking the time to install and configure the feature violates the scenario requirements for minimized setup time and administrative overhead.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not connect to the VM by using RDP and Remote Desktop Connection. While it is true that you can install an RDP server on Linux VMs running in Azure, this is not a default configuration and requires too much time and management effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not connect to the VM by using RDP and PowerShell Core 6.0. PowerShell Core 6.0 is available on Linux VMs deployed in Azure from the Azure Marketplace. However, the two in-box PowerShell remote management protocols are Web Services-Management (WS-Man) and SSH, not RDP.
