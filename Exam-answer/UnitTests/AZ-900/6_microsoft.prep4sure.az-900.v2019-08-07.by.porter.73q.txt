QUESTION 5
You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that you use for testing. VM1 is protected by Azure Backup.
You delete VM1.
You need to remove the backup data stored for VM1.
What should you do first?
A. Delete the Recovery Services vault.
B. Delete the storage account.
C. Stop the backup

D. Modify the backup policy.
Correct Answer: D
Section: [none]
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Azure Backup provides backup for virtual machines — created through both the classic deployment model and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model —
by using custom-defined backup policies in a Recovery Services vault.
With the release of backup policy management, customers can manage backup policies and model them to meet their changing requirements from a single
window. Customers can edit a policy, associate more virtual machines to a policy, and delete unnecessary policies to meet their compliance requirements.
Incorrect Answers:
B: You can't delete a Recovery Services vault if it is registered to a server and holds backup data. If you try to delete a vault, but can't, the vault is still configured to
receive backup data.

QUESTION 6
You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1.
You deploy a Linux virtual machine named VM1 to Subscription1.
You need to monitor the metrics and the logs of VM1.
What should you use?
A. the AzurePerformanceDiagnostics extension
B. Azure HDInsight
C. Linux Diagnostic Extension (LAD) 3.0
D. Azure Analysis Services
Correct Answer: A
Section: [none]
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:

You can use extensions to configure diagnostics on your VMs to collect additional metric data.
The basic host metrics are available, but to see more granular and VM-specific metrics, you need to install the Azure diagnostics extension on the VM. The Azure
diagnostics extension allows additional monitoring and diagnostics data to be retrieved from the VM.

QUESTION 7
DRAG DROP
You have an availability set named AS1 that contains three virtual machines named VM1, VM2, and VM3.
You attempt to reconfigure VM1 to use a larger size. The operation fails and you receive an allocation failure message.
You need to ensure that the resize operation succeeds.
Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the
correct order.
Select and Place:

Correct Answer:

Section: [none]
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Step 1: Stop VM1, VM, and VM3.
If the VM you wish to resize is part of an availability set, then you must stop all VMs in the availability set before changing the size of any VM in the availability set.
The reason all VMs in the availability set must be stopped before performing the resize operation to a size that requires different hardware is that all running VMs in
the availability set must be using the same physical hardware cluster. Therefore, if a change of physical hardware cluster is required to change the VM size then all
VMs must be first stopped and then restarted one-by-one to a different physical hardware clusters.
Step 2: Resize VM1.
Step 3: Start VM1, VM2, and VM3.

QUESTION 8
You plan to back up an Azure virtual machine named VM1.
You discover that the Backup Pre-Check status displays a status of Warning.
What is a possible cause of the Warning status?
A. VM1 is stopped.
B. VM1 does not have the latest version of WaAppAgent.exe installed.
C. VM1 has an unmanaged disk.
D. A Recovery Services vault is unavailable.
Correct Answer: B
Section: [none]
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
The Warning state indicates one or more issues in VM’s configuration that might lead to backup failures and provides recommended steps to ensure successful
backups. Not having the latest VM Agent installed, for example, can cause backups to fail intermittently and falls in this class of issues.

A. Move VM1 to Subscription2.
B. Modify the IP address space of VNet2.
C. Provision virtual network gateways.
D. Move VNet1 to Subscription2.
Correct Answer: C
Section: [none]
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
The virtual networks can be in the same or different regions, and from the same or different subscriptions. When connecting VNets from different subscriptions, the
subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.
Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet
connection type (VNet2VNet) is similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide
a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both function the same way when communicating.
The local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order
to route traffic.

Correct Answer: BC
Section: [none]
Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
B: A VPN gateway is used when creating a VPN connection to your on-premises network.
Route-based VPN devices use any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors, and let routing/forwarding tables direct traffic to different IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on
router platforms where each IPsec tunnel is modeled as a network interface or VTI (virtual tunnel interface).
C: Policy-based VPN devices use the combinations of prefixes from both networks to define how traffic is encrypted/decrypted through IPsec tunnels. It is typically
built on firewall devices that perform packet filtering. IPsec tunnel encryption and decryption are added to the packet filtering and processing engine.
Incorrect Answers:
D: Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address.

Explanation
Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
D: You can gradually roll out Seamless SSO to your users. You start by adding the following Azure AD URL to all or selected users' Intranet zone settings by using
Group Policy in Active Directory: https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com
E: Seamless SSO works with any method of cloud authentication - Password Hash Synchronization or Pass-through Authentication, and can be enabled via Azure
AD Connect.
Incorrect Answers:
A: Seamless SSO is not applicable to Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).
B: Azure AD connect does not port 8080. It uses port 443.
C: Seamless SSO needs the user's device to be domain-joined, but doesn't need for the device to be Azure AD Joined.

Scenario: Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.
Planned Azure AD Infrastructure include: The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
