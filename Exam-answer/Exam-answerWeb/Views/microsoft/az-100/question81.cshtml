                You use Azure VM Backup to back up all Windows Server and Linux VMs in Azure to a Recovery Services vault.

                One of your colleagues informs you that he accidentally deleted corp-archive-vm1. You inspect Azure Monitor and verify that the server has been backed up every night for the past two months even though it has been powered off the entire time.

        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                You should select the most recent crash-consistent restore point. A crash-consistent restore point is an Azure VM backup that is not guaranteed to boot and/or experience data loss. This is the only restore point possible when an Azure VM is backed up while it is powered off.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should then restore corp-archive-vm1 by creating a new VM. Azure VM Backup allows you to restore only the VM's disks, the entire VM as a new resource, or individual files from the VM's disks. In this situation you need to put the deleted VM back online as quickly as possible, so letting Azure VM Backup restore a new VM by using the restore point makes the most sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not select the most recent application-consistent restore point. This type of restore point is not available because the VM had been backed up while powered off. An application-consistent restore point is available when a Windows Server in Azure is backed up and the Shadow Copy Service (VSS) writer can guarantee the restored VM will boot up with no data loss or data corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not restore the corp-archive-vm1 disks and ARM template and redeploy the VM using Azure PowerShell. Doing so violates the time constraint in the scenario.
