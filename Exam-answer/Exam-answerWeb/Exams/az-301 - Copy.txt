Azure AD Domain Services for hybrid organizations
Organizations with a hybrid IT infrastructure consume a mix of cloud resources and on-premises resources. Such organizations synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. As hybrid organizations look to migrate more of their on-premises applications to the cloud, especially legacy directory-aware applications, Azure AD Domain Services can be useful to them.
Example: Litware Corporation has deployed Azure AD Connect, to synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. The identity information that is synchronized includes user accounts, their credential hashes for authentication (password hash sync) and group memberships.
az-301-q30.PNG
User accounts, group memberships, and credentials from Litware's on-premises directory are synchronized to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. These user accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available within the managed domain.
Box 2: User management occurs on-premises. The on-promises domain controller authenticates employee credentials.
You can federate your on-premises environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization. This sign-in method ensures that all user authentication occurs on-premises.

Note:
IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machinThe information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returneWhile any source or destination IP can be chosen,
IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.
IP flow verify looks at the rules for all Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to the network interface, such as a subnet or virtual machine NITraffic flow is then verified based on the configured settings to or from that network interfacIP flow verify is useful in confirming if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine.

Traffic Analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application activity in cloud networks. Traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher network security group (NSG) flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. With traffic analytics, you can:
✑ Identify security threats to, and secure your network, with information such as open-ports, applications attempting internet access, and virtual machines (VM) connecting to rogue networks.
✑ Visualize network activity across your Azure subscriptions and identify hot spots.
✑ Understand traffic flow patterns across Azure regions and the internet to optimize your network deployment for performance and capacity.
✑ Pinpoint network misconfigurations leading to failed connections in your network.
Service Map automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. With Service Map, you can view your servers in the way that you think of them: as interconnected systems that deliver critical services. Service Map shows connections between servers, processes, inbound and outbound connection latency, and ports across any TCP-connected architecture, with no configuration required other than the installation of an agent.

###
You plan to store data in Azure Blob storage for many years. The stored data will be accessed rarely.
You need to ensure that the data in Blob storage is always available for immediate access. The solution must minimize storage costs.
Which storage tier should you use?
---
A. Cool *
B. Archive
C. Hot
---
Azure cool tier is equivalent to the Amazon S3 Infrequent Access (S3-IA) storage in AWS that provides a low cost high performance storage for infrequently access data.
Note: Azure's cool storage tier, also known as Azure cool Blob storage, is for infrequently-accessed data that needs to be stored for a minimum of 30 days.
Typical use cases include backing up data before tiering to archival systems, legal data, media files, system audit information, datasets used for big data analysis and more.
The storage cost for this Azure cold storage tier is lower than that of hot storage tier. Since it is expected that the data stored in this tier will be accessed less frequently, the data access charges are high when compared to hot tier. There are no additional changes required in your applications as these tiers can be accessed using APIs in the same manner that you access Azure storage.
Incorrect Answers:
B: Even though Azure archive storage offers the lowest cost in terms of data storage, its data retrieval charges are higher than that of hot and cool tiers. In fact, the data in the archive tier remains offline until the tier of the data is changed using a process called hydration. The process of hydrating data in the archive storage tier and moving it to either hot or cool tier could take up to 15 hours and, hence, it is only intended for data that can afford that kind of access delay.
C: The storage cost for this Azure cold storage tier is lower than that of hot storage tier.

D
You have a virtual machine scale set named SS1.
You configure autoscaling as shown in the following exhibit.
az-301-q78.png
You configure the scale out and scale in rules to have a duration of 10 minutes and a cool down time of 10 minutes.
Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that answers each question based on the information presented in the graphic.
---
If SS1 scales to nine virtual machines, what is the minimum amount of time before SS1 will scale up?;10 minutes;20 minutes *;30 minutes;60 minutes;
If SS1 scales to nine virtual machines, and then the average processor utilization is 30 percent for one hour, how many virtual machines will be in SS1?;1;3;6;9 *;12;15;
---
Box 1: 20 Minutes. 10 minutes cool down time after the last scale-up plus 10 minutes duration equals 20 minutes.
Box 2: 9 virtual machines. 30% does not match the scale in requirement of less than 25% so the number of virtual machines will not change.

You manage an application instance. The application consumes data from multiple databases. Application code references database tables using a combination of the server, database, and table name.
You need to migrate the application instance to Azure.
What are two possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
---
A. SQL Server Stretch Database *
B. SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine
C. Azure SQL Database
D. SQL Managed Instance *
---
A: Access your SQL Server data seamlessly regardless of whether it's on-premises or stretched to the cloud. You set the policy that determines where data is stored, and SQL Server handles the data movement in the background. The entire table is always online and queryable. And, Stretch Database doesn't require any changes to existing queries or applications - the location of the data is completely transparent to the application.
D: The managed instance deployment model is designed for customers looking to migrate a large number of apps from on-premises or IaaS, self-built, or ISV provided environment to fully managed PaaS cloud environment, with as low migration effort as possible. Using the fully automated Data Migration Service (DMS) in Azure, customers can lift and shift their on-premises SQL Server to a managed instance that offers compatibility with SQL Server on-premises and complete isolation of customer instances with native VNet support.
