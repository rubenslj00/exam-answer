Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) uses channel partners for selling and servicing its products. As volume of leads has
increased, NTO has noticed a decrease in satisfaction from partners on the quality of leads and a noticeable decrease in
the lead conversion rate.

What should the consultant suggest in order to increase partner satisfaction with the leads being shared?

A. © Assign all leads to the partner channel manager to validate the lead data and manually assign to partners.

B. © Use the lead score on the Find Duplicates button and assign the leads with a score in the high category.

C. © Create a custom lead score field to assess lead quality and assign the leads that exceed this score to partners.

D. © Create multiple validation rules to ensure that all fields on the lead record are populated with data.
