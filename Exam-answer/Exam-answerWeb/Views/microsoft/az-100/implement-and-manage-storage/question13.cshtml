                <p>
                    The corporate governance team mandates that all future Azure resources be deployed only within certain regions.

                    To meet the new compliance requirement, you should deploy Azure Policy. Azure Policy is a governance feature that allows you to enforce requirements at two Azure scopes: the management group and the resource group. For example, you can require that all deployments are constrained to particular regions, or that only certain virtual machine (VM) sizes are allowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should not use RBAC. RBAC focuses on user actions at different scopes. For example, a user may be restricted with RBAC from creating VMs in any Azure region. By contrast, Azure Policy customizes the properties a user can choose during resource deployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should not use taxonomic tags. These key-value pairs are useful for organizing Azure resources (for instance, to identify different cost centers). However, tags have no authorization capability on their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should not use Activity Log Analytics. This management solution aggregates Azure activity log data in a Log Analytics workspace. Specifically, the activity log records control plane activities such as resource creation, but does not enforce authorization.
