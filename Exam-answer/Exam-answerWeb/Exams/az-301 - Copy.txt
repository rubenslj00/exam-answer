Your company uses Microsoft System Center "" Service Manager on its on-premises network.
You plan to deploy several services to Azure.
You need to recommend a solution to push Azure service health alerts to Service Manager.
What should you include in the recommendation?
---
A. Azure Notification Hubs
B. Azure Event Hubs
C. IT Service Management Connector (ITSM) *
D. Application Insights Connector
---
The IT Service Management Connector (ITSMC) allows you to connect Azure and a supported IT Service Management (ITSM) product/service.

Azure services like Log Analytics and Azure Monitor provide tools to detect, analyze and troubleshoot issues with your Azure and non-Azure resources. However, the work items related to an issue typically reside in an ITSM product/service. The ITSM connector provides a bi-directional connection between Azure and ITSM tools to help you resolve issues faster.

ITSMC supports connections with the following ITSM tools:

ServiceNow
System Center Service Manager
Provance
Cherwell
With ITSMC, you can:

Create work items in ITSM tool, based on your Azure alerts (metric alerts, Activity Log alerts and Log Analytics alerts).
Optionally, you can sync your incident and change request data from your ITSM tool to an Azure Log Analytics workspace.

C
You have an on-premises Hyper-V cluster. The cluster contains Hyper-V hosts that run Windows Server 2016 Datacenter. The hosts are licensed under a
Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that has Software Assurance.
The Hyper-V cluster hosts 3 virtual machines that run Windows Server 2012 R2. Each virtual machine runs a different workload. The workloads have predictable consumption patterns.
You plan to replace the virtual machines with Azure virtual machines that run Windows Server 2016. The virtual machines will be sized according to the consumption pattern of each workload.
You need to recommend a solution to minimize the compute costs of the Azure virtual machines.
Which two recommendations should you include in the solution? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
---
A. Purchase Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances for the Azure virtual machines *
B. Create a virtual machine scale set that uses autoscaling
C. Configure a spending limit in the Azure account center
D. Create a lab in Azure DevTest Labs and place the Azure virtual machines in the lab
E. Activate Azure Hybrid Benefit for the Azure virtual machines *

###
You are planning the implementation of an order processing web service that will contain microservices hosted in an Azure Service Fabric cluster.
You need to recommend a solution to provide developers with the ability to proactively identify and fix performance issues. The developers must be able to simulate user connections to the order processing web service from the Internet, as well as simulate user transactions. The developers must be notified if the goals for the transaction response times are not met.
What should you include in the recommendation?
---
A. container health
B. Azure Network Watcher
C. Application Insights *
D. Service Fabric Analytics
---
Part of Azure Monitor, Application Insights is an extensible platform for application monitoring and diagnostics. It includes a powerful analytics and querying tool, customizable dashboard and visualizations, and further options including automated alerting. Application Insights's integration with Service Fabric includes tooling experiences for Visual Studio and Azure portal, as well as Service Fabric specific metrics, providing a comprehensive out-of-the-box logging experience. Though many logs are automatically created and collected for you with Application Insights, we recommend that you add further custom logging to your applications to create a richer diagnostics experience.

Service Map automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. With Service Map, you can view your servers in the way that you think of them: as interconnected systems that deliver critical services. Service Map shows connections between servers, processes, inbound and outbound connection latency, and ports across any TCP-connected architecture, with no configuration required other than the installation of an agent.

Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for developers and DevOps professionals. Use it to monitor your live applications. It will automatically detect performance anomalies, and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app. It's designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability. It works for apps on a wide variety of platforms including .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python hosted on-premises, hybrid, or any public cloud. It integrates with your DevOps process, and has connection points to a variety of development tools. It can monitor and analyze telemetry from mobile apps by integrating with Visual Studio App Center.
