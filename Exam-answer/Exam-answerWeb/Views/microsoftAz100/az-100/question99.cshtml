                You have an Azure virtual network (VNet) named VNet1. VNet1 contains a subnet named Sub1 that hosts three Windows Server 2012 R2 virtual machines (VMs).

            <p>
                @Html.Raw(Model.H2OpenTag)
                You need to design a network security group (NSG) that blocks inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic from the Internet into Sub1.

            <p>
                How should you configure the NSG? To answer, drag the appropriate NSG configuration value to each NSG configuration property. A configuration value may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                Service tags make it easy to aggregate IP address blocks that otherwise would require several NSG rules to accomplish. You should use the Internet service tag because this tag includes all public IPv4 addresses not owned by Microsoft. By contrast, you should not use the AzureCloud service tag because this tag includes all Microsoft-owned IP address ranges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Application security groups are administrator-created service tags that allow you to group your VMs logically and reference them more conveniently in your NSG rule definitions. In this case, you should use the Any destination value because the scenario does not state that you created any application security groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your NSG should perform a Deny action on inbound Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 3389 traffic because this is the default port used by the RDP protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not use TCP 5985 in your NSG rule because 5985 is the default port used by the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service and Windows PowerShell remoting.
