###
Your company uses a Git repository in Azure Repos to manage the source code of a web application. The master branch is protected from direct updates.
Developers work on new features in the topic branches.
Because of the high volume of requested features, it is difficult to follow the history of the changes to the master branch.
You need to enforce a pull request merge strategy. The strategy must meet the following requirements:
Consolidate commit histories.
Merge the changes into a single commit.
Which merge strategy should you use in the branch policy?
---
squash merge *
fast-forward merge
Git fetch
no-fast-forward merge
---
Squash merging is a merge option that allows you to condense the Git history of topic branches when you complete a pull request. Instead of each commit on the topic branch being added to the history of the default branch, a squash merge takes all the file changes and adds them to a single new commit on the default branch.
A simple way to think about this is that squash merge gives you just the file changes, and a regular merge gives you the file changes and the commit history.
Note: Squash merging keeps your default branch histories clean and easy to follow without demanding any workflow changes on your team. Contributors to the topic branch work how they want in the topic branch, and the default branches keep a linear history through the use of squash merges. The commit history of a master branch updated with squash merges will have one commit for each merged branch. You can step through this history commit by commit to find out exactly when work was done.

You have a project in Azure DevOps. You have an Azure Resource Group deployment project in Microsoft Visual Studio that is checked in to the Azure DevOps project.
You need to create a release pipeline that will deploy resources by using Azure Resource Manager templates. The solution must minimize administrative effort.
Which task type should you include in the solution?
---
Azure Cloud Service Deployment
Azure RM Web App Deployment
Azure PowerShell *
Azure App Service Manage
---
There are two different ways to deploy templates to Azure DevOps Services. Both methods provide the same results, so choose the one that best fits your workflow.
1. Add a single step to your build pipeline that runs the PowerShell script that's included in the Azure Resource Group deployment project (Deploy-
AzureResourceGroup.ps1). The script copies artifacts and then deploys the template.
2. Add multiple Azure DevOps Services build steps, each one performing a stage task.
The first option has the advantage of using the same script used by developers in Visual Studio and providing consistency throughout the lifecycle.

You need to ensure that when there are multiple builds pending deployment, only the most recent build is deployed.
What should you use?
---
deployment conditions
deployment queue settings *
release gates
pull request triggers
---
The options you can choose for a queuing policy are:
Number of parallel deployments
If you specify a maximum number of deployments, two more options appear:
- Deploy all in sequence
- Deploy latest and cancel the others: Use this option if you are producing releases faster than builds, and you only want to deploy the latest build.
Incorrect Answers:
Release gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services, and then promote the release when all the signals are successful at the same time or stop the deployment on timeout. Typically, gates are used in connection with incident management, problem management, change management, monitoring, and external approval systems.

---
Scenarios and use cases for gates include:
Quality validation. Query metrics from tests on the build artifacts such as pass rate or code coverage and deploy only if they are within required thresholds.
Use Quality Gates to integrate monitoring into your pre-deployment or post-deployment. This ensures that you are meeting the key health/performance metrics
(KPIs) as your applications move from dev to production and any differences in the infrastructure environment or scale is not negatively impacting your KPIs.
Note: Gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services, and then promote the release when all the signals are successful at the same time or stop the deployment on timeout.

upstream sources *
---
Upstream sources enable you to manage all of your product's dependencies in a single feeWe recommend publishing all of the packages for a given product to that product's feed, and managing that product's dependencies from remote feeds in the same feed, via upstream sources. This setup has a few benefits:
Simplicity: your NuGet.config, .npmrc, or settings.xml contains exactly one feed (your feed).
Determinism: your feed resolves package requests in order, so rebuilding the same codebase at the same commit or changeset uses the same set of packages
Provenance: your feed knows the provenance of packages it saved via upstream sources, so you can verify that you're using the original package, not a custom or malicious copy published to your feed
Peace of minpackages used via upstream sources are guaranteed to be saved in the feed on first use; if the upstream source is disabled/removed, or the remote feed goes down or deletes a package you depend on, you can continue to develop and build

What should you do?
---
Request the Apple ID associated with the user of each device.
Register the devices on the Apple Developer portal. *
Create an active subscription in App Center Test.
Add the device owner to the organization in App Center.
 

---
When releasing an iOS app signed with an ad-hoc or development provisioning profile, you must obtain tester's device IDs (UDIDs), and add them to the provisioning profile before compiling a release. When you enable the distribution group's Automatically manage devices setting, App Center automates the before mentioned operations and removes the constraint for you to perform any manual tasks. As part of automating the workflow, you must provide the user name and password for your Apple ID and your production certificate in a .p12 format.
App Center starts the automated tasks when you distribute a new release or one of your testers registers a new device. First, all devices from the target distribution group will be registered, using your Apple ID, in your developer portal and all provisioning profiles used in the app will be generated with both new and existing device IAfterward, the newly generated provisioning profiles are downloaded to App Center servers.

Solution: Implement Continuous Assurance for the project.
Does this meet the goal?
---
Yes *
No

The basic idea behind Continuous Assurance (CA) is to setup the ability to check for "drift" from what is considered a secure snapshot of a system. Support for
Continuous Assurance lets us treat security truly as a 'state' as opposed to a 'point in time' achievement. This is particularly important in today's context when
'continuous change' has become a norm.
There can be two types of drift:
Drift involving 'baseline' configuration: This involves settings that have a fixed number of possible states (often pre-defined/statically determined ones). For instance, a SQL DB can have TDE encryption turned ON or OFF"¦or a Storage Account may have auditing turned ON however the log retention period may be less than 365 days.
Drift involving 'stateful' configuration: There are settings which cannot be constrained within a finite set of well-known states. For instance, the IP addresses configured to have access to a SQL DB can be any (arbitrary) set of IP addresses. In such scenarios, usually human judgment is initially required to determine whether a particular configuration should be considered 'secure' or not. However, once that is done, it is important to ensure that there is no "stateful drift" from the attested configuration. (E.g., if, in a troubleshooting session, someone adds the IP address of a developer machine to the list, the Continuous Assurance feature should be able to identify the drift and generate notifications/alerts or even trigger 'auto-remediation' depending on the severity of the change).
