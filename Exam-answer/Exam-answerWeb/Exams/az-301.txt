Azure AD Domain Services for hybrid organizations
Organizations with a hybrid IT infrastructure consume a mix of cloud resources and on-premises resources. Such organizations synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. As hybrid organizations look to migrate more of their on-premises applications to the cloud, especially legacy directory-aware applications, Azure AD Domain Services can be useful to them.
Example: Litware Corporation has deployed Azure AD Connect, to synchronize identity information from their on-premises directory to their Azure AD tenant. The identity information that is synchronized includes user accounts, their credential hashes for authentication (password hash sync) and group memberships.
az-301-q30.PNG
User accounts, group memberships, and credentials from Litware's on-premises directory are synchronized to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. These user accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available within the managed domain.
Box 2: User management occurs on-premises. The on-promises domain controller authenticates employee credentials.
You can federate your on-premises environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization. This sign-in method ensures that all user authentication occurs on-premises.

IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machinThe information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port. If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is returneWhile any source or destination IP can be chosen,
IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment.
IP flow verify looks at the rules for all Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to the network interface, such as a subnet or virtual machine NITraffic flow is then verified based on the configured settings to or from that network interfacIP flow verify is useful in confirming if a rule in a Network Security Group is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine.

You plan to store data in Azure Blob storage for many years. The stored data will be accessed rarely.
You need to ensure that the data in Blob storage is always available for immediate access. The solution must minimize storage costs.
Which storage tier should you use?
---
Cool *
Archive
Hot
---
Azure cool tier is equivalent to the Amazon S3 Infrequent Access (S3-IA) storage in AWS that provides a low cost high performance storage for infrequently access data.
Note: Azure's cool storage tier, also known as Azure cool Blob storage, is for infrequently-accessed data that needs to be stored for a minimum of 30 days.
Typical use cases include backing up data before tiering to archival systems, legal data, media files, system audit information, datasets used for big data analysis and more.
The storage cost for this Azure cold storage tier is lower than that of hot storage tier. Since it is expected that the data stored in this tier will be accessed less frequently, the data access charges are high when compared to hot tier. There are no additional changes required in your applications as these tiers can be accessed using APIs in the same manner that you access Azure storage.
Incorrect Answers:
Even though Azure archive storage offers the lowest cost in terms of data storage, its data retrieval charges are higher than that of hot and cool tiers. In fact, the data in the archive tier remains offline until the tier of the data is changed using a process called hydration. The process of hydrating data in the archive storage tier and moving it to either hot or cool tier could take up to 15 hours and, hence, it is only intended for data that can afford that kind of access delay.
The storage cost for this Azure cold storage tier is lower than that of hot storage tier.

Access your SQL Server data seamlessly regardless of whether it's on-premises or stretched to the cloud. You set the policy that determines where data is stored, and SQL Server handles the data movement in the background. The entire table is always online and queryable. And, Stretch Database doesn't require any changes to existing queries or applications - the location of the data is completely transparent to the application.
The managed instance deployment model is designed for customers looking to migrate a large number of apps from on-premises or IaaS, self-built, or ISV provided environment to fully managed PaaS cloud environment, with as low migration effort as possible. Using the fully automated Data Migration Service (DMS) in Azure, customers can lift and shift their on-premises SQL Server to a managed instance that offers compatibility with SQL Server on-premises and complete isolation of customer instances with native VNet support.

Box 1: Content Delivery Network -
A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Box 2: Azure Redis Cache -
Azure Cache for Redis is based on the popular software Redis. It is typically used as a cache to improve the performance and scalability of systems that rely heavily on backend data-stores. Performance is improved by temporarily copying frequently accessed data to fast storage located close to the application. With
Azure Cache for Redis, this fast storage is located in-memory with Azure Cache for Redis instead of being loaded from disk by a database.

Which two options should you recommend? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
---
Configure Azure Traffic Manager
Implement an Azure virtual network
Configure a routing table with forced tunneling *
Implement Azure ExpressRoute *
---
C: Forced tunneling lets you redirect or "force" all Internet-bound traffic back to your on-premises location via a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel for inspection and auditing.
This is a critical security requirement for most enterprise IT policies. Without forced tunneling, Internet-bound traffic from your VMs in Azure always traverses from
Azure network infrastructure directly out to the Internet, without the option to allow you to inspect or audit the traffic.
Forced tunneling in Azure is configured via virtual network user-defined routes.
ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider. With
ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365.
Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a co- location facility. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public Internet. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.

---
Resource to create in Azure: Dependency Agent
The Map feature in Azure Monitor for VMs gets its data from the Microsoft Dependency agent. The Dependency agent relies on the Log Analytics agent for its connection to Log Analytics. So your system must have the Log Analytics agent installed and configured with the Dependency agent.
Whether you enable Azure Monitor for VMs for a single Azure VM or you use the at-scale deployment method, use the Azure VM Dependency agent extension to install the agent as part of the experience.
In a hybrid environment, you can download and install the Dependency agent manually. If your VMs are hosted outside Azure, use an automated deployment method
Configuration to perform on the virtual machines: Enable Virtual Machine Scale Set
To set up Azure Monitor for VMs:
Enable a single Azure VM or virtual machine scale set by selecting Insights (preview) directly from the VM or virtual machine scale set.
Enable two or more Azure VMs and virtual machine scale sets by using Azure Policy. This method ensures that on existing and new VMs and scale sets, the required dependencies are installed and properly configured. Noncompliant VMs and scale sets are reported, so you can decide whether to enable them and to remediate them.
Enable two or more Azure VMs or virtual machine scale sets across a specified subscription or resource group by using PowerShell.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Azure Batch *
Azure Container Service
---
Azure Batch works well with intrinsically parallel (also known as "embarrassingly parallel") workloads. Intrinsically parallel workloads are those where the applications can run independently, and each instance completes part of the work. When the applications are executing, they might access some common data, but they do not communicate with other instances of the application. Intrinsically parallel workloads can therefore run at a large scale, determined by the amount of compute resources available to run applications simultaneously.

Overview -
Contoso, Ltd. is a US-based financial services company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in San Francisco.

Existing Environment -

Payment Processing System -
Contoso hosts a business-critical payment processing system in its New York data center. The system has three tiers: a front-end web app, a middle-tier web API, and a back-end data store implemented as a Microsoft SQL Server 2014 database. All servers run Windows Server 2012 R2.
The front-end and middle-tier components are hosted by using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The application code is written in C# and ASP.NET.
The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server
Agent jobs.
The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.
The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:
Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.
Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.
Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.

Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.
Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.
Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.
Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.
Historical Transaction Query System
Contoso recently migrated a business-critical workload to Azure. The workload contains a .NET web service for querying the historical transaction data residing in
Azure Table Storage. The .NET web service is accessible from a client app that was developed in-house and runs on the client computers in the New York office.
The data in the table storage is 50 GB and is not expected to increase.

Current Issues -
The Contoso IT team discovers poor performance of the historical transaction query system, at the queries frequently cause table scans.

Requirements -

Planned Changes -
Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
Migrate the payment processing system to Azure.
Migrate the historical transaction data to Azure Cosmos DB to address the performance issues.

Migration Requirements -
Contoso identifies the following general migration requirements:
Infrastructure services must remain available if a region or a data center fails. Failover must occur without any administrative intervention.
Whenever possible, Azure managed services must be used to minimize management overhead.
Whenever possible, costs must be minimized.
Contoso identifies the following requirements for the payment processing system:
If a data center fails, ensure that the payment processing system remains available without any administrative intervention. The middle-tier and the web front end must continue to operate without any additional configurations.
Ensure that the number of compute nodes of the front-end and the middle tiers of the payment processing system can increase or decrease automatically based on CPU utilization.
Ensure that each tier of the payment processing system is subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99 percent availability.
Minimize the effort required to modify the middle-tier API and the back-end tier of the payment processing system.

Generate alerts when unauthorized login attempts occur on the middle-tier virtual machines.
Ensure that the payment processing system preserves its current compliance status.
Host the middle tier of the payment processing system on a virtual machine.
Contoso identifies the following requirements for the historical transaction query system:
Minimize the use of on-premises infrastructure services.
Minimize the effort required to modify the .NET web service querying Azure Cosmos DB.
Minimize the frequency of table scans.
If a region fails, ensure that the historical transactions query system remains available without any administrative intervention.
Information Security Requirements
The IT security team wants to ensure that identity management is performed by using Active Directory. Password hashes must be stored on-premises only.
Access to all business-critical systems must rely on Active Directory credentials. Any suspicious authentication attempts must trigger a multi-factor authentication prompt automatically. legitimate users must be able to authenticate successfully by using multi-factor authentication.

Existing Environment -

Payment Processing System -
Contoso hosts a business-critical payment processing system in its New York data center. The system has three tiers: a front-end web app, a middle-tier web API, and a back-end data store implemented as a Microsoft SQL Server 2014 database. All servers run Windows Server 2012 R2.
The front-end and middle-tier components are hosted by using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The application code is written in C# and ASP.NET.
The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server
Agent jobs.
The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.
The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:
Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.
Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.
Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.

Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.
Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.
Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.
Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.

The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server
Agent jobs.
The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.
The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:
Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.
Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.
Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.

Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.
Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.
Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.
Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.
Historical Transaction Query System
Contoso recently migrated a business-critical workload to Azure. The workload contains a .NET web service for querying the historical transaction data residing in
Azure Table Storage. The .NET web service is accessible from a client app that was developed in-house and runs on the client computers in the New York office.
The data in the table storage is 50 GB and is not expected to increase.

Current Issues -
The Contoso IT team discovers poor performance of the historical transaction query system, at the queries frequently cause table scans.

Requirements -

Planned Changes -
Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
Migrate the payment processing system to Azure.
Migrate the historical transaction data to Azure Cosmos DB to address the performance issues.

Migration Requirements -
Contoso identifies the following general migration requirements:
Infrastructure services must remain available if a region or a data center fails. Failover must occur without any administrative intervention.
Whenever possible, Azure managed services must be used to minimize management overhead.
Whenever possible, costs must be minimized.
Contoso identifies the following requirements for the payment processing system:
If a data center fails, ensure that the payment processing system remains available without any administrative intervention. The middle-tier and the web front end must continue to operate without any additional configurations.
Ensure that the number of compute nodes of the front-end and the middle tiers of the payment processing system can increase or decrease automatically based on CPU utilization.
Ensure that each tier of the payment processing system is subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99 percent availability.
Minimize the effort required to modify the middle-tier API and the back-end tier of the payment processing system.

Generate alerts when unauthorized login attempts occur on the middle-tier virtual machines.
Ensure that the payment processing system preserves its current compliance status.
Host the middle tier of the payment processing system on a virtual machine.
Contoso identifies the following requirements for the historical transaction query system:
Minimize the use of on-premises infrastructure services.
Minimize the effort required to modify the .NET web service querying Azure Cosmos DB.
Minimize the frequency of table scans.
If a region fails, ensure that the historical transactions query system remains available without any administrative intervention.
Information Security Requirements
The IT security team wants to ensure that identity management is performed by using Active Directory. Password hashes must be stored on-premises only.
Access to all business-critical systems must rely on Active Directory credentials. Any suspicious authentication attempts must trigger a multi-factor authentication prompt automatically. legitimate users must be able to authenticate successfully by using multi-factor authentication.

---
Role-based access control (RBAC) focuses on user actions at different scopes. You might be added to the contributor role for a resource group, allowing you to make changes to that resource group.
Incorrect Answers:
If your organization has many subscriptions, you may need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions.
There are a few key differences between Azure Policy and role-based access control (RBAC). Azure Policy focuses on resource properties during deployment and for already existing resources. Azure Policy controls properties such as the types or locations of resources. Unlike RBAC, Azure Policy is a default allow and explicit deny system.
Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements.

Geo-redundant storage (GRS) is designed to provide at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability of objects over a given year by replicating your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region. If your storage account has GRS enabled, then your data is durable even in the case of a complete regional outage or a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable.
GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, but that data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.
Incorrect Answers:
If a datacenter-level disaster (for example, fire or flooding) occurs, all replicas in a storage account using LRS may be lost or unrecoverable. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft recommends using zone-redundant storage (ZRS), geo-redundant storage (GRS), or geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS).

You plan to migrate the virtual machines to an Azure subscription.
You need to recommend a solution to replicate the disks of the virtual machines to Azure. The solution must ensure that the virtual machines remain available during the migration of the disks.
Solution: You recommend implementing a Recovery Services vault, and then using Azure Site Recovery.

Site Recovery can replicate on-premises VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers (Windows and Linux), Azure Stack VMs to Azure.
Note: Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to secondary location, and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it.

You have an Azure Storage v2 account named storage1.
You plan to archive data to storage1.
You need to ensure that the archived data cannot be deleted for five years. The solution must prevent administrators from deleting the data.
Solution: You create a file share, and you configure an access policy.
Does this meet the goal?

Yes
No *

Instead of a file share, an immutable Blob storage is required.
Time-based retention policy support: Users can set policies to store data for a specified interval. When a time-based retention policy is set, blobs can be created and read, but not modified or deleted. After the retention period has expired, blobs can be deleted but not overwritten.
Note: Set retention policies and legal holds
1. Create a new container or select an existing container to store the blobs that need to be kept in the immutable state. The container must be in a general- purpose v2 or Blob storage account.
2. Select Access policy in the container settings. Then select Add policy under Immutable blob storage.
3. To enable time-based retention, select Time-based retention from the drop-down menu.
4. Enter the retention interval in days (acceptable values are 1 to 146000 days).

Immutable storage for Azure Blob storage enables users to store business-critical data objects in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state. This state makes the data non-erasable and non-modifiable for a user-specified interval. For the duration of the retention interval, blobs can be created and read, but cannot be modified or deleted. Immutable storage is available for general-purpose v2 and Blob storage accounts in all Azure regions.
Note: Set retention policies and legal holds
1. Create a new container or select an existing container to store the blobs that need to be kept in the immutable state. The container must be in a general- purpose v2 or Blob storage account.
2. Select Access policy in the container settings. Then select Add policy under Immutable blob storage.

Either -
3a. To enable legal holds, select Add Policy. Select Legal hold from the drop-down menu.

Or -
3b. To enable time-based retention, select Time-based retention from the drop-down menu.
4. Enter the retention interval in days (acceptable values are 1 to 146000 days).

You plan to archive 10 TB of on-premises data files to Azure.
You need to recommend a data archival solution. The solution must minimize the cost of storing the data files.
Which Azure Storage account type should you include in the recommendation?
---
Premium Storage (general purpose v1)
Standard StorageV2 (general purpose v2) *
Standard Storage (general purpose v1)
Premium StorageV2 (general purpose v2)
---
Standard StorageV2 supports the Archive access tier, which would be the cheapest solution.
Incorrect Answers:
Each Premium storage account offers 35 TB of disk and 10 TB of snapshot capacity
