Defining S3 buckets by item may cause partition distribution errors, which will impact performance.
Amazon S3 DELETE requests are eventually consistent, which may cause other users to view items that have already been purchased *
Amazon S3 DELETE requests apply a lock to the S3 bucket during the operation, causing other users to be blocked
Using Amazon S3 for persistence exposes the application to a single point of failure

---
C
Unlike a traditional web hosting model, inbound network traffic filtering should not be confined to the edge; it should also be applied at the host level. Amazon EC2 provides a feature named security groups. A security group is analogous to an inbound network firewall, for which you can specify the protocols, ports, and sourceIP ranges that are allowed to reach your EC2 instances. You can assign one or more security groups to each EC2 instance. Each security group routes the appropriate traffic to each instance. Security groups can be configured so that only specific subnets or IP addresses have access to an EC2 instance. Or they can reference other security groups to limit access to EC2 instances that are in specific groups.https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-web-hosting-best-practices.pdf
###
A company is launching a new static website on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. The company wants to ensure that all web requests go through onlyCloudFront.How can a Solutions Architect meet this requirement?

Configure the S3 bucket policy to allow only CloudFront IP addresses to read objects.
Create IAM users in a group that has read access to the S3 bucket. Configure CloudFront to pass credentials to the S3 bucket.
Create a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI), then update the S3 bucket policy to allow the OAI read access. *
Convert the S3 bucket to an EC2 instance, then give CloudFront access to the instance by using security groups.

---
C
To allow access to your Amazon S3 bucket only from a CloudFront distribution, first add an origin access identity (OAI) to your distribution. Then, review your bucket policy and Amazon S3 access control list (ACL) to be sure that:
Only the OAI can access your bucket.
CloudFront can access the bucket on behalf of requesters.

An online retailer has a series of flash sales occurring every Friday. Sales traffic will increase during the sales only and the platform will handle the increased load.The platform is a three-tier application. The web tier runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. Amazon CloudFront is used to reduce web server load, but many requests for dynamic content must go to the web servers.What should be done to the web tier to reduce costs without impacting performance or reliability?
---
Use T-series instances
Purchase scheduled Reserved Instances. *
Implement Amazon ElastiCache.
Use Spot Instances.
---
---
B
Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule. For example, you can use ScheduledInstances for an application that runs during business hours or for batch processing that runs at the end of the week.If you require a capacity reservation on a continuous basis, Reserved Instances might meet your needs and decrease costs.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-scheduled-instances.html
###
A company's new web application running on Amazon EC2 across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) will be heavily accessed during regular business hours. After business hours, usage will be minimal.What fleet-scaling approach should be used to size the EC2 fleet to handle the traffic demands?
---
Manual scaling across all AZs
Provisioning for peak traffic
Scheduled scaling *
Programmatic termination of all instances in one AZ during off-peak hours
---
---
C
Scaling based on a schedule enables you to scale your application in response to predictable changes in demand. To use scheduled scaling, you create scheduled actions, which tell Spot Fleet to perform scaling activities at specific times. When you create a scheduled action, you specify the Spot Fleet, when the scaling activity should occur, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity. You can create scheduled actions that scale one time only or that scale on a recurring schedule.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-scheduled-scaling.html

An application provides a feature that allows users to securely download private and personal files. The web server is currently overwhelmed with serving files for download. A Solutions Architect must find a more effective solution to reduce web server load and costs, and must allow users to download only their own files.Which solution meets all requirements?
---
Store the files securely on Amazon S3 and have the application generate an Amazon S3 pre-signed URL for the user to download. *
Store the files in an encrypted Amazon EBS volume, and use a separate set of servers to serve the downloads.
Have the application encrypt the files and store them in the local Amazon EC2 Instance Store prior to serving them up for download.

The finance department needs to know the number of calls that are made to the service to validate the billing statements.How can a Solutions Architect design a system to durably store the number of calls without requiring changes to the application?
---
Call the service through an internet gateway.
Decouple the application from the service with an Amazon SQS queue.
Publish a custom Amazon CloudWatch metric that counts calls to the service. *
Call the service through a VPC peering connection.

An environment has an Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones referred to as AZ-a and AZ-b and a default termination policy. AZ-a has four AmazonEC2 instances, and AZ-b has three EC2 instances. None of the instances is protected from a scale-in.How will Auto Scaling proceed if there is a scale-in event?
---
Auto Scaling selects an instance to terminate randomly.
Auto Scaling terminates the instance with the oldest launch configuration of all instances.
Auto Scaling selects the Availability Zone with four EC2 instances and then continues to evaluate. *
Auto Scaling terminates the instance with the closest next billing hour of all instances.
---
---
C
For Auto Scaling Groups with Multiple Instance Types and Purchase Options, the scale-in action respects the On-Demand base amount and the percentages set for On-Demand and Spot Instances. When the group scales in, the Auto Scaling group first identifies which of these two types of instances it will terminate. Then, it chooses the Availability Zone with the most instances of that type, and applies the default or customized termination policy.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html

The unified CloudWatch agent enables you to do the following:Collect more system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems. The metrics can include in-guest metrics, in addition to the metrics forEC2 instances. The additional metrics that can be collected are listed in Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent.
Collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers. These can include servers in a hybrid environment as well as servers not managed by AWS.
Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collected protocols. StatsD is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows Server. collectd is supported only on Linux servers.
Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.You can store and view the metrics that you collect with the CloudWatch agent in CloudWatch just as you can with any other CloudWatch metrics. The default namespace for metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent is CWAgent, although you can specify a different namespace when you configure the agent.The logs collected by the unified CloudWatch agent are processed and stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, just like logs collected by the older CloudWatch Logs agent.
